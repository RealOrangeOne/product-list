Simple product storage system for unit 312 of my apprenticeship

### Wait, what's this for?!
I created this __really simple__ program for my apprenticeship, and the section about OOP.

We had to make a program with multiple objects, that saved data to the file system. So I chose to do this product management CLI.

I decided to write the system using C#, because I hadnt written anything in C# for a while, and never using Mono, so I thought i'd give it a shot!
